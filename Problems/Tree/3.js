// A B+ tree is a type of tree data structure that is commonly used in databases and file systems for indexing and organizing large amounts of data. It is similar to a B-tree but with some additional properties that make it particularly well-suited for disk-based storage systems.

// Here are some key characteristics of a B+ tree:

// Balanced Tree Structure: Like B-trees, B+ trees are balanced, meaning that all leaf nodes are at the same level and the height of the tree is kept relatively small.
// Multiple Keys Per Node: Each node in a B+ tree can contain multiple keys and corresponding pointers to child nodes or data records.
// Non-Leaf Nodes Contain Only Keys: In contrast to B-trees, in a B+ tree, only leaf nodes contain pointers to data records. Non-leaf nodes contain only keys for navigation purposes.
// Sequential Access and Range Queries: B+ trees are optimized for range queries and sequential access. Because all leaf nodes are linked together in a linked list, sequential access becomes efficient.
// High Fanout: B+ trees have a high fanout, meaning that each node can contain a large number of keys. This reduces the height of the tree and improves search performance.
// Disk-Based Storage Efficiency: B+ trees are designed with disk-based storage systems in mind. The structure and properties of B+ trees minimize the number of disk accesses required to search, insert, or delete data, making them efficient for large datasets stored on disk.
