// Let's consider a simple example graph to illustrate both articulation points and biconnected components:
//        A
//      /  \    
//     B    C    
///   / \  / \ 
//   D - E - F

// In this example:

// Vertices: A, B, C, D, E, F
// Edges: (A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (B, E), (C, E), (C, F), (D, E), (E, F)
// Now, let's analyze articulation points and biconnected components in this graph:

// Articulation Points:
// If we remove vertex E along with its incident edges (DE and EF), the graph splits into two disconnected components: {A, B, C} and {D, F}. Therefore, vertex E is an articulation point.
// Similarly, removing vertices B and C would also disconnect the graph, so they are also articulation points.
// However, vertices A, D, and F are not articulation points because removing them would not disconnect the graph.
// Biconnected Components:
// The graph has two biconnected components:
// {A, B, D, E} (formed by the edges AB, BD, DE)
// {C, E, F} (formed by the edges CE, EF)
// In each biconnected component, any two vertices are connected by two disjoint paths, and removing any single vertex (and its incident edges) does not disconnect the component.
