# Time complexity is a measure used in computer science to analyze the efficiency of algorithms. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. In simpler terms, time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases.

## Time complexity is typically expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the asymptotic growth rate of the algorithm's runtime.

# Some common time complexity classes and their characteristics include:

1. O(1) - Constant time: The runtime of the algorithm is constant, regardless of the size of the input.


2. O(log n) - Logarithmic time: The runtime of the 
algorithm grows logarithmically with the size of the input.


3. O(n) - Linear time: The runtime of the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.
O(n log n) - Linearithmic time: The runtime of the algorithm grows linearly multiplied by the logarithm of the input size.


4. O(n^2), O(n^3), ... - Quadratic, cubic, and other polynomial times: The runtime of the algorithm grows polynomially with the size of the input.
O(2^n), O(n!) - Exponential and factorial time: The runtime of the algorithm grows exponentially or factorially with the size of the input.
