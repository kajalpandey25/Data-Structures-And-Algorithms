# Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. This approach is particularly useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller, simpler subproblems of the same type.

## Key Concepts in Recursion

1. Base Case: The simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly without further recursion. The base case stops the recursive calls and prevents infinite loops.

2. Recursive Case: The part of the function where the problem is divided into smaller instances of the same problem, and the function calls itself to solve these smaller instances.

## How Recursion Works
When a recursive function is called, the following steps occur:

1. The current state of the function is saved.

2.The function calls itself with a modified argument, representing a smaller or simpler version of the original problem.

3. This process continues until the base case is reached.

4. Once the base case is reached, the function returns a value.

5. Each recursive call returns a value to the previous call, eventually resolving the entire original problem.
