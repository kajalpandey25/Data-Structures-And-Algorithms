# A linked list is a common data structure used in computer science to store a sequence of elements. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists store elements in nodes, where each node contains both the data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

## Tpes of linked list
Linked lists come in different variations, each suited to particular use cases and requirements. Here are some common types of linked lists:

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
4. Doubly Circular Linked List
5. Sorted Linked List
6. Sparse Linked List
7. Hash Linked List
