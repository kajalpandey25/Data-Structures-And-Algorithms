# Tree data structures(non-linear) are hierarchical data structures that are modeled after the concept of a tree in graph theory. They consist of nodes connected by edges, where each node has zero or more child nodes, except for the topmost node in the hierarchy, which is called the root node and has no parent. The nodes further down the hierarchy are called internal nodes, and nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.

## A binary tree is a type of tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These children are distinct and ordered, meaning that one child is designated as the left child and the other as the right child.

## In a binary tree:

# 1. Root Node: The topmost node in the tree, which has no parent.

# 2. Parent and Child: Each node has at most one parent and can have zero, one, or two children.

# 3. Internal Node: A node with at least one child.

# 4. Leaf Node: A node with no children.

# 5. Binary Search Tree (BST): A specific type of binary tree where the values of nodes in the left subtree are less than the value of the parent node, and the values of nodes in the right subtree are greater than the value of the parent node. This property facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and deletion , Traversal operations.
