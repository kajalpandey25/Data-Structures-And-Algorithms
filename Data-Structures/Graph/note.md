# A graph data structure(Non-Linear) is a way of representing relationships between objects. It consists of a collection of vertices (or nodes) and a collection of edges that connect pairs of vertices. Each edge typically represents a relationship between two vertices.

## Graphs can be classified into various types based on different characteristics:

# 1. Directed vs. Undirected Graphs: In a directed graph, edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship between vertices. In an undirected graph, edges do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship.

# 2. Weighted vs. Unweighted Graphs: In a weighted graph, each edge has an associated weight or cost, representing some quantitative measure of the relationship between vertices. In an unweighted graph, all edges have the same weight, or the weight is not considered.

# 3. Cyclic vs. Acyclic Graphs: A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle, which is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. An acyclic graph, also known as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), does not contain any cycles.
